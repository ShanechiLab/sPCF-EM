# sPCF-EM: Switching Poisson Cubature Filter - Expectation Maximization <br/>

Future home for the new sPCF-EM method for learning parameters for a switching dynamical system with Poisson observations. The Journal of Neural Engineering paper will be out roughly by the end of November 2023. All code and links will be added and updated here.
